# CSS The Right Way
Workshop files and solutions for CSS the Right Way

Before starting the workshop, download the repository.
You will find an html file (css-workshop.html), an images folder containing all the images you'll need along with mock-ups and a spec image of the page we're building. In the css folder you'll find the css file (css-workshop.css), where you'll do most of the work. In the HTML file, feel free to add classes as necessary, but you shouldn't need to alter the markup in any other way.

Since all of this is on the front-end, there is no reason to spin up a server. You should be able to view all your changes locally.

There is also a solutions folder. But keep in mind that there are as many right answers as there are people in this workshop, and even more wrong answers. Try not to look at the potential solution until you're done.

Have fun!
